API Liste für die Idee:


Ich hab ein paar Apis rausgesucht, (viel von top ten Listen etc.) und hab die Beschreibungen ein wenig runtergekürzt. Überfliegt sie einfach nur, wir müssen dann eh austesten, welche sich am besten und einfachsten nutzen lassen.


Rezept und Produkt Api:

Users can visualize recipe nutrition and ingredient lists, analyze recipe costs, find recipes by nutritional requirements, favorite ingredients, or what's in the refrigerator, classify recipes, convert ingredient amounts, and even compute an entire meal plan. The service covers ingredients, recipes, food products, and menu items.
