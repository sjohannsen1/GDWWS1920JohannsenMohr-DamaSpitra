    "prep": "1. In a small bowl, toss the prawns with the smoked paprika and a little sea salt and black pepper. Heat a small frying pan with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Sear the prawns for 1 minute each side. Remove, let cool and halve lengthways. Set aside. 2. Grate the cheese and spread half of it over two tortillas. Drain the beans and roughly chop the jalapeños, then sprinkle over, along with the prawns. Finely chop most of the coriander (reserving some leaves to finish), then divide between the tortillas, cover with the remaining cheese and top with the other tortillas. 3. Put two frying pans over a low-medium heat and add 1 teaspoon of oil to each pan. Brown the tortillas on one side for 3 to 4 minutes, until the cheese is melted and golden, taking care not to let them burn. Turn them over and cook for 3 minutes. If the pan is looking a little dry, add another tiny drizzle of vegetable oil. 4. Once the cheese has melted, remove the quesadillas from the pan and cut each one into six triangles. Serve straight away, topped with a dollop of soured cream and salsa, the pickled jalapeños and the remaining coriander leaves."}
