Cook for 5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the beans are crisp and begin to pop. Peel and destone the avocados, then smash in a bowl and squeeze in the lime juice. Finely chop the tomato, peel and finely chop the garlic and onion, then finely chop the coriander. Add all this to the avocado, mix well and season to taste. Spread the guacamole over a serving plate and sprinkle over the popped beans and mixed seeds. Serve with crunchy veggies and seeded crispbreads on the side for dipping"}
